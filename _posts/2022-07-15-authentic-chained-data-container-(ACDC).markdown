## Definition

In brief, an ACDC or [ADC](authentic-data-container-(ADC)) proves digital data consistency and authenticity in one go. An ACDC cryptographically secures commitment to data contained, and its identifiers are self-addressing, which means they point to themselves and are also contained Ã¬n the data.
