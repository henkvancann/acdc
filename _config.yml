# Welcome to Jekyll!
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

  Why is this site necessary? 
  To be understood, takes that we (the KERI / ACDC team) try to understand you.
  Who? For all those who are not programmers, nor cryptography experts, nor can read code.
  For those interested in why this technology could be a break-through, and has the ability to
  change (our view on) our digital presence, digital rights and digital autonomy. Discover your true digital twin.
  How? Through language, concepts, terminology and glossaries. And offer the meaning and the criteria why 
  terms include or exclude certain other terms. Think of
  Issuer, Controller, Validator, Verifier, Proof, Root-of-trust, etc. and more in general
  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Autonomic Identifiers (AID), `KERI`, `OOBI`, `CESR`, and `ACDC`.
